# Box Office Movie analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis of some of the top Box office movies so as to generate insights for Microsoft who want to join this industry.I then translated my findings into insights and even came up with recommendations that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio should use on deciding the type of movies to create.
